```{r}

Code book to provide information on structure, contents and conversions in the data analysis:

The following R-packages are installed:

library(xlsx)
        - To write the tidy data sets to the local drive.
library(xlsxjars)
	- To write the tidy data sets to the local drive.
library(plyr)
	- To use mapvalues command in the data analysis. 
library(reshape)
To aggregate the rows by its group. melt and cast commands are used in the data analysis.


Data Preparation:

The complete raw data for the run_analysis is made available from the zip file, getdata_projectfiles_UCI HAR Dataset. Extract  the raw zip file to access  test files, train files, activity_labels, features, features_info.

Import the required data for analysis:
Test measurements
X_test.txt is loaded to X_test in R
Training measurements
X_train.txt is loaded to X_train in R 
Column headers for test  & training measurements
features.txt is  loaded to features in R
Activity data is extracted from y_test.txt and y_train.txt
y_test.txt is loaded to y_test in R
y_train.txt is loaded to y_train in R
Activity labels are extracted from the following file:
activity_labels.txt is loaded to activity_labels in R
Subject data is extracted from the following file:
subject_test.txt, subject_train.txt are loaded to subject_test and subject_train in R



Data transformation:

 Merge measurement data:
         rbind X_test  and X_train data to add as rows and load the data to a data frame mer_X_test_train. 
         Extract the variable names from features and add them as column names to the measurement dataframe:
         extract the variable names from features and add them as colnames to mer_X_test_train
 Merge the activity data and add a column name to the activity data
         extract y_test and y_train data and rbind them to mer_Y_test_train.
        Add column name, activity to the merged y test/train data
 Merge subject test and subject train data
        rbind subject_test and subject_train to mer_sub_test_train
        add column name subject_ID to to the mer_sub_test_train
 combine 1,2,3, steps and to create the master data set:
        cbind mer_sub_test_train,mer_Y_test_train,mer_X_test_train to subj_acti_meas


Data Results: First tidy data set
Extract columns containing values  mean and standard deviation
Subset columns containing text: mean, std
create data frame, d to subset columns with mean values using grep()
create data frame, e to subset columns with standard deviation values using grep()
cbind the subject_ID, activity, columns with mean and standard deviation
Add activity labels based on the activity id
using mapvalues command find and replace activity values ("1","2","3","4","5","6"), to activity labels, c("WALKING","WALKING_UPSTAIRS","WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS","SITTING","STANDING","LAYING")
Write the tidy data set to a table and save it to the local.


Data Results: Second tidy data set

Aggregate all the variables by mean  each subject_ID and activity label
Write the second tidy data set to a table and save it to the local.
